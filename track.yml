  Learn OpenShift in your own sandbox
  ===================================

  OpenShift, built on Kubernetes, is a container management platform. With
  OpenShift, you can build, deploy and run containers in a production-grade
  environment. It includes a continuous integration server, a smart routing
  layer and a container registry. All accessible using a user-friendly user
  interface.
